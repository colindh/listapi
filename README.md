This includes a setup for staticaly served files in the "public" where the front end assets and minified front end app are kept.  A folder called "server" is for the pre-minified front end app and the rest endpoints.  The test folder holds the jasmine tests for both the front and back end.

Useful commands:
npm install to install dependencies
npm jshint to run jshint on all code
